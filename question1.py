#Question 1
#Question: Write a program which will find all such numbers 
#which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, 
#between 2000 and 3200 (both included). 
#The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated 
#sequence on a single line.

#create an empty list
#num = []
#for i in range(2000, 3201):
#    if i%7 == 0 and i%5 != 0:
#        num.append(str(i))

#print(",".join(num))  

  
#converting int to string
#type casting
a = "10"
b = str(10)
print(a+b)

#Define a function that can convert a integer into a string and print it in console.
#Hints:
#Use str() to convert a number to string.

#creating a function
#passing a parameter
def int_to_string(number):
    num1 = str(number)
    print(num1)
#calling back the function
int_to_string(19999)
